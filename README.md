## Installation
 
### Install Meteor
https://www.meteor.com/install

https://guide.meteor.com/

### Install MongoDB
This is so you will be able to import the eiffel data.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

### Import data to MongoDB
If you have the data (named **eiffelevents.json**) and the server is running, run the following command:

```
mongoimport --host localhost:3001 --jsonArray --drop --db meteor --collection eiffel-events --file "eiffelevents.json"
```
If you want to download sample data, you can find it [here](https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/tddd96/visualization/blob/development/public/examples/eiffelevents.zip).



## How to use the app

### How to select a node
You select a node by simply klicking it, and when you do that a 
pop-up will appear. The pop-up will display more details about the node.

### How to select a time-interval
You select a time-interval by adjusting the start- and 
end-controls located below the graph in the level called 
"Aggregation". You can also select a specific date-interval
 in the **From**- and **To**-boxes.
 
### How to set the amount of events shown
I you are interested in adjusting the amount of events that are
 shown at any given time you can adjust the number in the box
  called **Soft limit**. This box is found below the graph in
  **Aggregation**.
  
  *Note*: The soft limit is usually never the exact amount of
  events that are shown. The box called **Sequences shown**
  shows the exact amount.

### How to move between levels
You can move between levels easily by using the navigation bar
 located at the top right side of the screen. Each button is named
 according to the level it will take you to once pressed.
 
### How to find help
If you need information about what different components in the
app mean or what they do, you can click the icon
![alt text](https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/tddd96/visualization/tree/master/public/examples/smaller_info_logo.PNG "info_logo").
This icon is found below the navigation bar that you 
use to navigate between the different parts of the application.

### How to read the graphs
The graphs contain nodes which represent events generated by
different parts of a CI-system. The events that are displayed
should be read from left to right with respect to time, meaning
that the node to the far right in the graph is the last 
event created chronologically in the selected time-interval.


## How to develop
The application was built following the Meteor standard 
which can be found on the Meteor [website](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app).

This means for example that the creation and retrieval of graphs 
is done in **imports/api** and the frontend code is handled in 
**imports/ui**. So if you want to develop the application further,
simply follow the Meteor standard.

(Something about backend?)
